It had been a while since I'd used Unity for anything, so I wanted to play around with it and let a project emerge naturally from it.

So far it's a very simple platformer where a king jumps on snakes. It may evolve from there later, but I think I'm done with it for now until I have some design ideas that could fit with it.

It occurred to me that I should post a release of the current version in case anyone wants to play with it:
